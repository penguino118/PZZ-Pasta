# PZZ Pasta
A modding tool for .PZZ packages in [**GioGio's Bizarre Adventure (PS2)**](https://jojowiki.com/GioGio%27s_Bizarre_Adventure), driven by [infval's scripts for compression and decompression](https://github.com/infval/pzzcompressor_jojo). <br>
**Extract .PZZ** and **Repack .PZZ** will extract and repack any given .pzz file. **Extract Folder** and **Repack Folder** will perform the same operations to all found .pzz files in the input folder.
# Settings
## **Truncate Text Files**
Truncates null bytes on extraction for dialogue scripts for 3D (Demo Type) and 2D (Book Type) cutscenes.
## **Unpack Repack Texture Batches (.txb)**
Unpacks and repacks TIM2 (.tm2) files contained in extracted .txb files.
## **Fix Color Table Sizes**
Adjusts CLUT sizes on unpacked TIM2 textures for correct detection in miscellaneous editing programs.
